**Order Cancellation Policy**

1. **Cancellation Period**: Customers may cancel their order within twenty-four (24) hours of placing it. No cancellation will be accepted beyond this timeframe.

2. **Notification of Cancellation**: To initiate a cancellation, customers must contact our Customer Support Team within the specified 24-hour period. Cancellations can be requested through our official customer support channels, which include our website contact form, customer support email, or by calling our dedicated support hotline, all of which are available on our "Contact Us" page.

3. **Eligibility for Cancellation**: All items are eligible for cancellation within the designated period unless they fall under the following exceptions:
    - Customized or personalized items that have already entered the production process.
    - Items that have already been dispatched or shipped to the customer prior to the cancellation request.

4. **Processing the Cancellation**: Once the cancellation has been requested and deemed eligible within the allowed timeframe, our team will process the cancellation. The order status will be updated to "Cancelled," and the customer will receive a confirmation email acknowledging the cancellation.

5. **Refund Process**: Upon successful cancellation of an order, any funds charged will be refunded to the customer. The refund process is as follows:
    - **Refund Method**: Refunds will be issued using the original method of payment whenever possible. If the original payment method is no longer available, an alternative arrangement may be made, subject to our discretion.
    - **Refund Timeframe**: The refund will be processed within 5-7 business days after the order is confirmed as cancelled. However, the timing for the refunded amount to reflect in the customer's account will depend on the policy of the financial institution associated with the customerâ€™s payment method.

6. **Modifications to Orders**: If a customer wishes to modify their order within the 24-hour window, such as changing the size or color of an item, they should follow the same procedure for cancellations. They will need to cancel the original order and place a new one with the correct specifications.

7. **Late Cancellations**: If a customer attempts to cancel an order after the 24-hour cancellation period has passed, we will not be able to guarantee cancellation. As such, customers are encouraged to thoroughly review their orders prior to confirmation.

8. **Additional Assistance**: For any further inquiries or special circumstances regarding the cancellation of an order, customers should reach out to our Customer Support Team for assistance.

9. **Policy Updates**: This policy is subject to change. We reserve the right to modify or update these cancellation terms at any time. Customers are encouraged to review the policy periodically for the latest information on our cancellation terms.
