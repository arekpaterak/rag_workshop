**Delivery Issues Policy**

At our company, we are committed to ensuring that your items reach you in a timely and secure manner. However, on rare occasions, delivery issues may occur. This policy outlines the steps to be taken in such instances.

1. **Delayed Delivery Due to Item Availability**: 
   - If an item's availability causes a delay, we will notify you via email or phone with an estimated delivery date.
   - You will have the option to wait for the item to come back in stock or request a refund/cancellation of the order.

2. **Carrier Delivery Delay**:
   - If a delay occurs while the package is with the carrier, we will investigate the cause and provide updates.
   - We ask for your patience during this time, as some delays related to the carrier or external circumstances may be beyond our control.

3. **Package Reported as Delivered but Not Received**:
   - Contact our Customer Support Team within 48 hours of the delivery report if you do not receive your package.
   - We will investigate with the carrier and, if necessary, file a claim for the lost package.
   - You may be asked to confirm your shipping address and verify if there are any safe places where the package could have been placed.

4. **Lost Package**:
   - If a package is deemed lost after investigation with the carrier, we will initiate a replacement or full refund of your order, depending on item availability and your preference. 
   - A package is typically considered lost if there is no update from the carrier within a timeframe of 7-10 business days from the last known location.

5. **Timeframes for Reporting**:
   - Delivery Delay: Please contact us if your tracking information shows no movement for more than 7 business days.
   - Package Not Received: Report within 48 hours from the time the package is marked as delivered according to the carrier's tracking system.

6. **Refunds for Lost Packages or Significant Delays**:
   - If we determine that the package cannot be delivered or is irretrievably lost, we will offer you the choice between a replacement or a refund.
   - Refunds will be processed back to your original payment method within 7 business days of the decision.
