    "## Splitting documents\n",
    "It is especially desirable to retrieve knowledge from enormous knowledge bases that are hard to traverse by humans. For example, imagine thousands of pages of legal documentation. Reading it would take long days for a single person. One of the limitations of LLMs are limited context windows which comes from the quadratic complexity of the [transformer attention layer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html). Because of that, long documents should be split into smaller, meaningful chunks of text. The split can't be done randomly, it would break the meaning of sentences and may cause loss of information. Thankfully, LangChain delivers a library of [text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) that you can use. In this exercise the policies are relatively short and can easily fit the context window. The default text splitter will leave them undivided. However, you can experiment with the `chunk_size` to see how the splitter slices the document into meaningful chunks of text."
